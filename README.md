# Quantum Neural ODE (QNODE) - Machine Learning for Quantum Dynamics

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Latent Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)** model to learn and predict quantum system dynamics, specifically focusing on open quantum systems with amplitude damping. The model learns continuous-time quantum evolution from discrete measurement data, providing a machine learning approach to quantum dynamics prediction.

## Scientific Context

### Problem Statement
Traditional quantum dynamics are governed by the Lindblad master equation for open quantum systems. However, solving these equations analytically or numerically can be computationally expensive for complex systems. This project explores whether neural networks can learn quantum dynamics directly from data, potentially offering faster predictions and insights into quantum system behavior.

### Amplitude Damping Channel
The amplitude damping channel models energy loss in quantum systems (e.g., spontaneous emission in atoms). It's characterized by:
- **Kraus operators** that describe the quantum evolution
- **Lindblad master equation** that governs the density matrix evolution
- **Stochastic trajectories** that represent individual quantum measurements

## Technical Architecture
